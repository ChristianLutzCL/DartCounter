# DartCounter

## Dart Counter is a little Flask-Python application.

I create DartCounter to have some nice statistics of my Dart-Games.
My idea is, to provide a simple and clean Darts-App based on Flask/Python.

It should work like every normal Darts App.
First, you choose your prefered number of players, gamemode and points.
After that, you get to the "game" and can start to play darts.
Input your points one after another and the next player can play.

After a completed game, this app will show some statistics about the game and every player.
